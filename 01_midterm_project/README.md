**Description**

Nowadays, loan approval is one of the core functions of banks and other financial institutions. Our objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on their load datas. We aim to provide a tool for financial institutions to make faster and more accurate decisions in loan approval process.

The dataset can be accessed directly from Kaggle [Loan Approval Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e10/data).

**Project Steps**

1. Data preparation and data cleaning
2. EDA, feature importance analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model selection process and parameter tuning, performance will be evaluated using ROC AUC.
5. Save the best performing model as `train.py` 
6. Load model to script `predict.py` , Serving it via a web service with Flask.
7. Containerization with Docker

**Note**

*Due to missing the submission deadline for the midterm project, I intend to repurpose it as the Capstone1 of [Datatalks Machine Learning Engineering zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master).*
